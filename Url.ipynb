    "Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan. It features an ensemble cast led by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. It was Lynda Obst's final film as producer before her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interstellar premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on October 26, 2014, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5, and in the United Kingdom on November 7. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, and $758.6 million worldwide with subsequent releases, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Among its various accolades, Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects.\n",

    "Plot\n",
    "In the mid-21st century, humanity faces extinction due to dust storms and widespread crop blights. Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that, 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously travelled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper is enlisted to pilot the Endurance spacecraft through the wormhole as part of a mission to colonize a habitable planet with 5000 frozen embryos and ensure humanity's survival. Meanwhile, Professor Brand would continue his work on solving a gravity equation whose solution would supposedly enable construction of spacecraft for an exodus from Earth. Cooper accepts against Murph's wishes and promises to return. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crew, consisting of Cooper, robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, traverse the wormhole after a two-year voyage to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time they leave the planet, Cooper and Brand discover that 23 years have elapsed on the Endurance. Having enough fuel left for only one of the other two planets, Cooper and Romilly decide to go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting, despite Brand's protests. En route, they receive messages from Earth and Cooper watches Tom grow up, get married, and lose his first son. An adult Murph is now a scientist working on the gravity equation with Professor Brand. On his deathbed, Brand confesses that the Endurance crew was never supposed to return, knowing that a complete solution to the equation was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from inside a black hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Mann's planet, they awaken him from cryostasis, and he assures them that colonization is possible, despite the extreme environment. During a scouting mission, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified his data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race back to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance, but Cooper is able to regain control of the station through his own docking maneuver.\n",
    "\n",
    "With insufficient fuel, Cooper and Brand resort to a slingshot around Gargantua, which costs them 51 years due to time dilation. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison their landers to lighten the Endurance so that Brand and CASE may reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into Gargantua's event horizon, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract made up of infinite copies of Murph's bedroom across moments in time. Cooper deduces that the tesseract was constructed by advanced humans in the far future, and realizes that he had always been Murph's \"ghost\". He uses Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murph the data that TARS collected, which enables her to complete Brand's solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tesseract, its purpose fulfilled, collapses before ejecting Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes up on a station orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murph, now elderly and on her deathbed, who tells him to seek out Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up the human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.\n",

    "Production\n",
    "Development and financing\n",
    "The premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[5][6] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans\", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[7] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[8][9] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[10]\n",
    "\n",
    "After Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[11] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[12] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[13] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[14] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[15] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[16] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[17] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.[18] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and casting\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dust Bowl phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by Ken Burns in The Dust Bowl (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.\n",
    "Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[5] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology.[20] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them\", before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[12][21] Among the elements from the original script that Christopher removed was how gravitational waves were used for detecting the wormhole—and then regretted it after LIGO detected gravitational waves just little over a year later.[22] He kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource-depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.[5] He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[5] After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted the director, Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar.[23]\n",
    "\n",
    "Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom \"the audience could experience the story\".[24] He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud,[24] which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[5] Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective.[25] Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script for Interstellar.[26] In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[27] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[26] Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[28]\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal photography\n",
    "Nolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography.[29] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014);[30] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films.[31] More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[24] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[5] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[32] Nolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.\"[33] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora's Letter,[34] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland was used as a filming location for Interstellar, doubling for Mann's planet.\n",
    "The film's principal photography was scheduled to last four months.[28] It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada.[19] Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.[34] For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,[11] intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[12] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.[35] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.[34]\n",
    "\n",
    "Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005).[36] It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[5] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[12] They spent two weeks shooting there,[28] during which a crew of about 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[37][38] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered from hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California.[39] Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[40] Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Production design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Endurance spacecraft (left) is based on the International Space Station (right).\n",
    "Interstellar features three spacecraft— the Endurance, a ranger, and a lander. The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE.[5] The human space habitats resemble O'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1976.[41]\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound design\n",
    "Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process.[42] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[43] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[11] The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\"[44] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[45]\n",
    "\n",
    "Music\n",
    "Main article: Interstellar (soundtrack)\n",
    "Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[46][47] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual effects\n",
    "The visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar.[48] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens.[5] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[49]\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranger, Endurance, and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig.[50] New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[49]\n",
    "\n",
    "Influences\n",
    "Nolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982),[51] Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979).[52] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,[53] who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature.[54] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production,[5] following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.[12] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[55] Clark Kent's upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[21] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.\n",
    "Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations\".[56] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations [...] would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[9] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[57] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[9]\n",

    "The astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[58] Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it\".[59] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come\". Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent\".[60]\n",

    "To create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[6] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature[61]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[62] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[63][64][65]\n",

    "Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[66] Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[67]\n",

    "As a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[68] of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.[69]\n",

    "Scott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is \"as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done\" and considered the film \"more personal\" than Nolan's previous films.[158] Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the \"dull\" dialogue and \"tedious patches inside the space vessel\".[159] David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for \"being so loud\" as to make some of the dialogue \"inaudible\". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film's scientific concepts.[160] Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it \"a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour\".[161] James Berardinelli called Interstellar \"an amazing achievement\" and \"simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.\"[162] He named it the best film of 2014,[163] and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a \"real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers\".[164]\n",

    "Describing Nolan as a \"merchant of awe\", Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was \"agonisingly\" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and \"deep-digging intelligence\" of the film.[170] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.\"[171] In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its \"big-screen grandeur\", while finding some of the dialogue \"clunky\". He described it further as \"an absurd endeavor\" and \"one of the most sublime movies of the decade\".[172] Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film \"has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing\", and \"thin characters\" despite seeing the film twice in order to \"give it a second chance\". He wrote that Interstellar \"ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies.\"[173] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan's excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, \"[Interstellar] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away ... At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.\"[174]\n",

    "New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among \"science and faith and science and the humanities\" and \"illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms\".[175] Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship.[176] Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan's films are \"rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,\" and that \"although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-cli-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything. It reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see\".[177] Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar \"the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick's 2001.\"[178] In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.[179]\n",

Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that, 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously travelled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results.\",\n",
       " \"Cooper is enlisted to pilot the Endurance spacecraft through the wormhole as part of a mission to colonize a habitable planet with 5000 frozen embryos and ensure humanity's survival. Meanwhile, Professor Brand would continue his work on solving a gravity equation whose solution would supposedly enable construction of spacecraft for an exodus from Earth. Cooper accepts against Murph's wishes and promises to return. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.\",\n",
       " \"The crew, consisting of Cooper, robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, traverse the wormhole after a two-year voyage to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines.\",\n",
       " \"By the time they leave the planet, Cooper and Brand discover that 23 years have elapsed on the Endurance. Having enough fuel left for only one of the other two planets, Cooper and Romilly decide to go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting, despite Brand's protests. En route, they receive messages from Earth and Cooper watches Tom grow up, get married, and lose his first son. An adult Murph is now a scientist working on the gravity equation with Professor Brand. On his deathbed, Brand confesses that the Endurance crew was never supposed to return, knowing that a complete solution to the equation was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from inside a black hole.\",\n",
       " \"On Mann's planet, they awaken him from cryostasis, and he assures them that colonization is possible, despite the extreme environment. During a scouting mission, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified his data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race back to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance, but Cooper is able to regain control of the station through his own docking maneuver.\",\n",
       " 'With insufficient fuel, Cooper and Brand resort to a slingshot around Gargantua, which costs them 51 years due to time dilation. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison their landers to lighten the Endurance so that Brand and CASE may reach Edmunds\\' planet. Falling into Gargantua\\'s event horizon, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract made up of infinite copies of Murph\\'s bedroom across moments in time. Cooper deduces that the tesseract was constructed by advanced humans in the far future, and realizes that he had always been Murph\\'s \"ghost\". He uses Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murph the data that TARS collected, which enables her to complete Brand\\'s solution.',\n",

Obst was attached to produce.[8][9] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[10]',\n",
       " \"After Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[11] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[12] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[13] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[14] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[15] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[16] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[17] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[12]\",\n",
       " 'Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan\\'s production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.[18] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film\\'s production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.[19]',\n",

       " 'Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[5] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology.[20] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"[11]',\n",
       " 'His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them\", before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[12][21] Among the elements from the original script that Christopher removed was how gravitational waves were used for detecting the wormhole—and then regretted it after LIGO detected gravitational waves just little over a year later.[22] He kept in place Jonathan\\'s conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource-depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.[5] He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[5] After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted the director, Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar.[23]',\n",
       " 'Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom \"the audience could experience the story\".[24] He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud,[24] which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[5] Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective.[25] Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan\\'s home, where she read the script for Interstellar.[26] In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[27] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[26] Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[28]',\n",

To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[24] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[5] Some of the film\\'s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[32] Nolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.\"[33] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora\\'s Letter,[34] Flora being one of Nolan\\'s four children with producer Emma Thomas.[12]',\n",
       " \"The Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland was used as a filming location for Interstellar, doubling for Mann's planet.\",\n",
       " \"The film's principal photography was scheduled to last four months.[28] It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada.[19] Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.[34] For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,[11] intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[12] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.[35] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.[34]\",\n",
       " 'Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005).[36] It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[5] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[12] They spent two weeks shooting there,[28] during which a crew of about 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[37][38] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered from hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured.[12]',\n",
       " 'After the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California.[39] Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[40] Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[12]',\n",

The Endurance, the crew\\'s mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It\\'s a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It\\'s really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger\\'s function is similar to the Space Shuttle\\'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"[5]',\n",
       " 'The film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It\\'s based on mathematics. You\\'ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it\\'s all proportional.\" Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE.[5] The human space habitats resemble O\\'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O\\'Neill in 1976.[41]',\n",

       " 'Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film\\'s audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process.[42] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[43] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[11] The studio\\'s website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\"[44] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[45]',\n",

Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[46][47] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[11]\",\n",
       " 'Visual effects',\n",
       " \"The visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar.[48] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens.[5] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[49]\",\n",
       " 'The ranger, Endurance, and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig.[50] New Deal Studio\\'s miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[49]',\n",

       " 'Nolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982),[51] Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979).[52] Andrei Tarkovsky\\'s The Mirror (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,[53] who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature.[54] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg\\'s Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production,[5] following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts\\' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.[12] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[55] Clark Kent\\'s upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[21] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[12]',\n",

       " 'Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein\\'s general relativity equations\".[56] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations [...] would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[9] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[57] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[9]',\n",
       " 'The astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere\\'s oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[58] Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don\\'t really know what\\'s in a black hole, so take it and run with it\".[59] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come\".

Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[6] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature[61]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[62] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[63][64][65]',\n",

The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand.

A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[94] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[29] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[95][96] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[97]\",\n",

Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[99] McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as \"backward\", as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[100]',\n",

       " 'Scott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is \"as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done\" and considered the film \"more personal\" than Nolan\\'s previous films.[158] Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the \"dull\" dialogue and \"tedious patches inside the space vessel\".[159] David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for \"being so loud\" as to make some of the dialogue \"inaudible\". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film\\'s scientific concepts.[160] Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it \"a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour\".[161] James Berardinelli called Interstellar \"an amazing achievement\" and \"simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.\"[162] He named it the best film of 2014,[163] and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a \"real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers\".[164]',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they\\'re living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world.

Love.\"[169]',\n",
       " 'Describing Nolan as a \"merchant of awe\", Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was \"agonisingly\" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and \"deep-digging intelligence\" of the film.[170] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.\"[171] In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its \"big-screen grandeur\", while finding some of the dialogue \"clunky\". He described it further as \"an absurd endeavor\" and \"one of the most sublime movies of the decade\".[172] Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film \"has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing\", and \"thin characters\" despite seeing the film twice in order to \"give it a second chance\". He wrote that Interstellar \"ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of \\'go into space to save the world\\' movies.\"[173] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan\\'s excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, \"[Interstellar] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan\\'s work melted away ... At times, the movie\\'s one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.\"[174]',\n",
       " 'New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among \"science and faith and science and the humanities\" and \"illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms\".[175] Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship.[176] Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan\\'s films are \"rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,\" and that \"although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-cli-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything. It reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see\".[177] Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar \"the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick\\'s 2001.\"[178] In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.[179]',\n",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=ChatFireworks(client=<fireworks.client.chat_completion.ChatCompletionV2 object at 0x000002232390CF40>, async_client=<fireworks.client.chat_completion.ChatCompletionV2 object at 0x000002232390D6F0>, model_name='accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v3', model_kwargs={}, fireworks_api_key=SecretStr('**********')), output_parser=StrOutputParser(), llm_kwargs={}), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'HuggingFaceEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x00000223168B48B0>, search_kwargs={}))"

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: How much did Apple’s stock drop after Trump's tariff comments?\\n=========\\nContent: \\\"Among the biggest drags was Apple, which dropped 3.5 percent after Trump proposed a sweeping tariff on foreign-made iPhones sold in the U.S.\\\"\\nSource: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-markets-sink-as-donald-trump-rekindles-trade-tensions-apple-drops-over-3-13044073.html\\n\\nContent: \\\"Apple drops over 3%\\\"  \\n\\nThis text is relevant to the question, as it directly states the percentage drop in Apple’s stock following Donald Trump’s comments on tariffs.\\nSource: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-markets-sink-as-donald-trump-rekindles-trade-tensions-apple-drops-over-3-13044073.html\\n\\nContent: \\\"US markets sink as Donald Trump rekindles trade tensions; Apple drops over 3%\\\"  \\n\\nRelevant text: \\\"Apple drops over 3%\\\"\\nSource: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-markets-sink-as-donald-trump-rekindles-trade-tensions-apple-drops-over-3-13044073.html\\n\\nContent: The provided text does not mention Apple's stock or its specific performance in relation to Trump's tariff comments.
